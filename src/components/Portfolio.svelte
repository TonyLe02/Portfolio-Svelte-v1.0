    <p class="text-xl mb-4">
      During my third semester at the University of Agder, I participated in a
      challenging programming project from Nøsted &. Our task was to create an
      information system for the maintenance of winches. We designed a model for
      filling out service forms that employees or mechanics could complete, as
      well as checklists that needed to be ticked off.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      All the form information was stored in a database using MariaDB. With this
      data, we were able to set up a service order overview. This allowed us to
      go back to the order, view the information added, and make changes as
      needed.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The project was developed using .NET and C#, which required us to become
      familiar with these technologies. This provided us with valuable
      experience in using powerful tools for web development.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      I'm also happy to share that I got an A during this project. The images
      below provide a glimpse into the user interface of our application. They
      showcase the service form and checklist features, as well as the service
      order overview. Our goal was to create a user-friendly interface that made
      the maintenance process more efficient and manageable.
